In my finalwork,i created small squares of corresponding size and color based on the picture's data.And then i put the tinter into this project to make these squares bring out some messages.It should be noted that the object must be based on the length and width of the canvas,especially the pixels.The reason why i want to make a project like this is that i think pictures are the most direct way to convey some informations.Otherwise,it's a very simple way to mke pictures more vivid.
The most important item in my work is the renderer.I should pay attention to all the stuff and make sure that they are all rendered.The canvas is the second part that i should pay attention to.The scale and pixel are two main causes in my work,which depend on canvas' size and scale.The controller is actually contained with all the items mentioned.
I had also added some other parts into my work to make it perfect,like the camera system and map.I think three.js is a programe that need some innovations and creativity.So i should always try some new ideas and things.
