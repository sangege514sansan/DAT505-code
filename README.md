    It's an octagon with extrodinary colors and rotating clockwise.

## Section2  

    I used three different items tomap the small boxes.

    It's my homework and i used the square model and round model to form an interspace.
## Section4   


    This homework used some inspirations from the class.

## Section5   

    This homework is to change the squares' speed and shape.
## Section6   

    It's totally a transparent building world.
## Section7   

    This task including two parts. The first one is a small box using optional texture and droping  out. The second one is the rolling eyes.

    The first one is the warships with accompaniment music and the mouse can change ships' color.The second is the  twinking  and teleporting roundness.    
## Finalwork

    In my finalwork,i created small squares of corresponding size and color based on the picture's data.And then i put the tinter into this project to make these squares bring out some messages.It should be noted that the object must be based on the length and width of the canvas,especially the pixels.The reason why i want to make a project like this is that i think pictures are the most direct way to convey some informations.Otherwise,it's a very simple way to mke pictures more vivid.
    The most important item in my work is the renderer.I should pay attention to all the stuff and make sure that they are all rendered.The canvas is the second part that i should pay attention to.The scale and pixel are two main causes in my work,which depend on canvas' size and scale.The controller is actually contained with all the items mentioned.
    I had also added some other parts into my work to make it perfect,like the camera system and map.I think three.js is a programe that need some innovations and creativity.So i should always try some new ideas and things.
